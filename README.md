## Clusters Project built for Solana

Clusters is a decentralized finance (DeFi) tool that allows users to create, rebalance, and manage portfolios of Tezos-based tokens — like an exchange-traded fund (ETF), but for Solana tokens — which are themselves tradeable on crypto exchanges. Users can create their own indexes, or buy into someone else’s and share in the success of their portfolio strategies.

Assets created on Clusters similarly to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — derivative assets that provide exposure to baskets of securities, and which trade like a stock. Users can create baskets of crypto tokens, bundle them up into a batch, and then buy, sell, or trade those  batches on exchanges.  

Clusters lets you carry out sophisticated asset-management strategies by determining the exact allocation of individual tokens, setting automated rebalancing parameters, and engaging with a developing suite of functions.

Why Clusters is worth your attention?
Clusters being somewhat similar to Ethereum's well-known Set-protocol ( allows users to to create ERC-20 assets). Tokens that are used for issuing clusters provide liquidity to issue flash loans.
